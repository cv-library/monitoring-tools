        1-plugins/check_logfiles command checks against haproxy.log to search for ERRRORs. 
        script returns: 
        OK - no errors or warnings|job_info_errors_lines=2853 job_info_errors_warnings=0 job_info_errors_criticals=0 job_info_errors_unknowns=0

        2-nrpe service running on the host. It might get timing out and not giving response to nagios server.
        
        3-filebeat with pipeline exporting only the errors to cerebro would make it more reliable.
        it is not grouped or aggregated between APP Servers, that means, it is individual per server. 
        Checking the haproxy api and leverage the builtin health check turns into a more reliable check.
